# Ruby Loops - Full Lecture

## Objective

Students will learn about loop, break, while, and until

+ LOOPS - Use `loop` and `break`
+ LOOPS - Use `while` and `until`

## Loops

Remember way back when we learned about methods? We said that there's an issue about repeating a method like a dance over and over and over again.

```ruby
def two_step
  puts "Step to the left."
  puts "Step to the right."
end

two_step
two_step
two_step
```

How would we tell the two_step to just keep on going, to never stop, just keep on repeating? _Do the dance, it never stops_

You'd really want to keep on dancing as long as the music is playing (and if you're me, even after).
